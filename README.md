## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The EdTech industry is experiencing exponential growth, with recorded lectures at the forefront of learner preference. Our clientâ€”an ambitious EdTech startupâ€”aims to refine their recorded course offerings. To support this mission, we built a **Power BI dashboard** that visualizes critical insights gathered from top platforms.

This analysis helps:

- Identify content gaps
- Optimize course design
- Align with learner preferences
- Highlight top-performing instructors

Here we have also achieved project aims as mentioned in file below
